--SPOTIFY PROJECT

--I performed analytics on Spotify song data downloaded from Kaggle that I used to populate a table created with the following code:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )
;

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

--Which artists appear on the list more than once?

Select artist_name, Count(artist_name) 
FROM Bit_db.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING Count(artist_name) >1
;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity desc
limit 10
;

--What's the average danceability, loudness, energy, tempo, and duration for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT Round(AVG(danceability), 4), ROUND(avg(loudness), 4), Round(avg(energy), 4), ROUND(avg(tempo), 4), ROUND(avg(duration_ms), 2)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
limit 10;
;

--Which songs are the most popular AND best to dance to?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, ROUND((popularity*danceability), 3) AS dance_pop_score
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY dance_pop_score DESC
;
